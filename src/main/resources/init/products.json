    "description": "The best of Bose. Now with built-in Google Assistant\nThe QuietComfort II wireless headphones are designed with noise reduction and are now even better. With the built-in Google Assistant, you can play music, receive messages, and answer calls without looking at your phone.\n\nThe QC35 II has Google Assistant built directly into the headset. This means you can listen to music, receive messages, manage your daily tasks and answer calls - all with your voice. Just press and hold the Action button and start a conversation with Google Assistant. And the QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones still feature world-class noise cancellation technology that blocks noise and lets you immerse yourself in music.\n\nIf you're not a Google user, don't worry. You can use the Action button to adjust the noise reduction level between the three settings.\n\nPress the button. Feel the music.\n\nYou know the feeling. The way you feel when the rest of the world disappears and you are transported to a place where only you and your music are. With acoustic noise cancellation technology, you can feel it at the touch of a button. It continuously measures, compares and responds to external noise, then cancels it with the opposite signal. You can adjust the noise reduction level between three levels to better suit the environment. So, after all, music makes you feel it, you can really feel it. With nothing on the road.\n\nWhen you want to carry music everywhere with you, you need good-built headphones to handle it. With impact-resistant materials filled with nylon glass and corrosion-resistant stainless steel, they are designed to survive on the road. But when you take them everywhere and listen all day, they should be comfortable. Covered with Alcantara® - the soft cover material used in yachts and modern cars - they offer high comfort and are designed for listening all day long. And the soft earphones are made of synthetic protein leather, so you won't even feel like you're wearing headphones.\n\n20 hours battery life\n\nEnjoy up to 20 hours of listening time, enough time to go through the entire playlist. And when the battery finally runs out, a 15-minute fast charge gives you another 2.5 hours. For that rare moment when the battery runs out, use the included cable to connect and continue playing music.\n \nYou want simplicity and clarity for your music, no matter how strong it is. That's why drivers have an equalizer optimized for volume and better performance than before. When you listen at low volume in a quiet office, you get the same consistent quality as when you have to turn it on on a busy street.\n\nThe app can make a difference\n\nThe free app makes it easy to connect and switch between devices. But this is just the beginning. You can also control noise reduction levels directly from the app. Each update gives you new items. See how a simple and intuitive application makes a difference.\n\nAcoustic noise\n\nContinuously measures, compares and responds to external noise. It then cancels it with the reverse signal.\n\nOEM optimized equalizer\n\nFor consistent performance at any volume.\nFlawless calls\nListen and talk. Even when it's windy.\nGoogle assistant\n\nJust press and hold the Action button and start a conversation with your Google Assistant.\n\nVoice instructions\nCalls via Bluetooth® pairing.\nBattery\nListen until 8 p.m. And then the fast 15-minute charge gives you another 2.5 hours.",

    "description": "Bose Sport headphones\n\nDesigned for the best workout\n\nThe Bose Sport headphones are designed from the start to support your workout with realistic sound and a comfortable fit. Our own technology makes your music clear and balanced, no matter how hard you listen to it. The elegant design of the headphones allows them to fit snugly in the ears. No matter how long you train, the headphones will not fall, no matter how much you move. Get ready to beat your record over and over again.\n\nBose Sport headphones make your music look like the artist is right next to you, forcing you to walk another mile or do another replay. The patented acoustic port design and high-performance premium drivers combine to deliver great sound in a small acoustic package. Optimized for volume, the equalizer automatically increases the lows and highs, so music, videos, and voices always seem balanced at every listening level. And the new StayHear ™ Max tips create a tight seal with the ear canal - essential for hearing deep, low notes that add impact and emotion to your music and to block out ambient noise around you so you can focus on the music and your workout.\n\nThe Bose Sport headphones come in three sizes for StayHear ™ Max ears, so you can find the right ones for you. Each surface that touches the ear is made of soft silicone - not hard plastic - and by applying even pressure to the ear, the ear tips avoid putting extra pressure on the most sensitive parts. Meanwhile, the unique umbrella-shaped tip and the extended flexible wing keep the Bose Sport headphones in place - without the need for an ear hook - no matter how much you shake your head or move.\n\nDesigned to withstand moisture caused by sweating and weathering, the Bose Sport headphones have undergone rigorous quality and durability tests to ensure they stay in great shape, just like you. They also have protection class IPX4, which means that the electronic devices in each handset are protected against water splashes if it rains while running.\n\nWhen you receive a phone call while wearing a Bose Sport headset, instead of interrupting your workout, simply double-tap the right handset to answer, or press and hold to reject. If you answer, you will clearly hear the call in both ears. Meanwhile, thanks to the set of microphones that form the beam that will separate the voice from the surrounding noise, the caller will also hear you clearly.\n\nInstead of buttons, the Bose Sport headphones have a capacitive touch interface. This means that the outer surface of each handset works like a touchpad. Swipe up and down on the right earpiece to control the volume, double-tap to play or pause music, and answer calls. Double-tap the left handset to activate a shortcut option of your choice, such as checking the battery level (which you can configure in the Bose Music app).\n\nWith True Wireless, Bluetooth®, Bose Sport headphones offer complete freedom of movement. As long as you are less than 9 meters (30 feet) from the device, you will hear everything play. And with a personalized antenna hidden outside each handset, you'll stay connected.\n\nUp to 5 hours of battery life on a single charge\n\nThe Bose Sport headphones offer up to five hours of battery life on a single charge. They are charged by placing them in the included charging box. If the box is charged, it will automatically charge the headphones. When fully charged, the box can provide two full charges for another 10 hours of use. And if the battery runs out when you're on the go, you can quickly get up to two hours of playback on a 15-minute charge.\n\nThe Bose Sport headphones connect to the free Bose Music app, which allows you to name your headphones, adjust the controls as you wish, check battery life, manage your Bluetooth connections and much more. We also receive software updates with new features that the company is working on. Don't forget to download it so you don't miss anything.",
